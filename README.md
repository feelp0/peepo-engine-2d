# peepo-engine-2d
My first dumb attempt creating a 2D engine in C with SDL

# What can this bad boi do?
Atm peepo-engine-2d have:  
  -GameObjects and components system;  
  -Single image or animation (from a sprite sheet) rendering;  
  -Scene managment;  
  -UI and UI events (atm OnPointerEnter, OnPointerExit, OnClick);  
  
# Can you use this?
Why should you? Well if you really want of course! but I'm pretty sure there are better custom engine around :)
